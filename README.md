# Overview of Project
I analyzed UFO sightings data in order to create a webpage and table. I filtered this data by UFO sightings date, city, state, country, and shape. 

# Results
On the left-hand side of the webpage there is a filter search. You can filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. You can filter multiple fields at a time. After you have entered all search criteria, the table will show the date, city, state, country, shape, the amount of time the sighting took place, and a description of the sighting.

# Summary
One drawback of this design is that it does not give the user any information as to where to start their search. The user would have know some information before they begin their search on the site.

1.One recommendation is to have a drop down menu of choices for city, state of UFO sights.

2.Another recommendation would be to have clear all criteria so that users can quickly clea and search other information.
